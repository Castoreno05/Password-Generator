# Password-Generator

Are you having trouble coming up with random passwords? Let the Password-Generator generate a password from 8-128 characters.

When you input a number, the length will be generated into a password containing random uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. 

Reuse the password whenever its needed, just remember to save the generated password on another application.
